# Nate's Netsuite Workspace

## Description
So this is to be able to work on some netsuite stuff.

In this we're following a guide set by Robin Mitchell.

Essentially, we install the suitebundle "head in the cloud upload resetlet" which to my knowledge just comes with Netsuite kind of. It has to be installed.

Next, in our coding space, we want NPM and Gulp.

Then we make our gulp file, our tsconfig.json, our "Head in the Cloud" (HITC) upload and upload token.

And after this we can be able to upload with `gulp build-and-upload --file "ssv2/myfile.ts"`

Only stuff in the `ssv2` folder will get built and uploaded.

Netsuite stuff can be written with TypeScript in this way.
